## Project Title
Bonus Calculator App

## Purpose of Project
This project aims to demonstrate that calculators are not just practical tools, but also excellent mediums for understanding user interface (UI) design and event processing in software applications. Our Bonus Calculator App offers basic arithmetic operations along with some advanced scientific functions like square roots and logarithms.

## How to Start This Project
To start this project, you will need a Java runtime environment and JavaFX installed on your computer. After installing these prerequisites, you can run the project by executing the `CalculatorApp.java` file in your Java IDE or from the command line.

## User Instructions
1. **Starting the App**: Launch the `CalculatorApp` from your Java IDE or by using the `java` command in the terminal.
2. **Using the Calculator**: 
   - The calculator interface includes buttons for digits 0-9, basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), and equals.
   - For advanced operations like square roots or logarithms, select the corresponding buttons on the UI.
   - Enter numbers and operations by clicking on the buttons in the UI.
   - Use the 'C' button to clear the last entry and 'AC' to clear all entries.
3. **Error Handling**: If any operation exceeds the 8-digit limit, 'ERR' will be displayed.

## Additional Information
- **Constraints**: This calculator does not use the `eval()` function for executing calculations.
- **UI Design**: The UI design is intuitive, closely resembling standard calculator apps with additional functions for advanced operations.
- **Contributions**: Team members are encouraged to contribute by adding new features, fixing bugs, or enhancing the UI.

## Using GitHub for Collaboration
- **Committing Changes**: Regularly commit your changes with descriptive messages.
- **Branching**: Create branches for new features or major changes.
- **Pull Requests**: Use pull requests for merging changes from branches to the main codebase.
- **Issue Tracking**: Utilize GitHub's issue tracking for bugs or feature requests.
